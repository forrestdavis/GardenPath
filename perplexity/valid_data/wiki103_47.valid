Ward LeRoy Churchill ( born 1947 ) is an American author and political activist . He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007 . The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government . His work features controversial and provocative views , written in a direct , often confrontational style .
In January 2005 , Churchill 's work attracted controversy because of the circulation of a 2001 essay , " On the Justice of Roosting Chickens " , in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful US foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century ; the essay is well known for Churchill 's use of the phrase " little <unk> " to describe the " technocratic corps " working in the World Trade Center .
In March 2005 the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research misconduct ; it reported in June 2006 that he had done so . Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the " Little <unk> " comment . Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment . In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was wrongly fired , awarding him $ 1 in damages . In July 2009 , a District Court judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill 's request to order his reinstatement , deciding the university has " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " . In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge 's decision . In November 2010 , the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the lower @-@ court 's ruling . In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ' decisions in favor of the University of Colorado . On April 1 , 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case .
In a February 2014 interview , Churchill commented that after living more than forty years in the northern plains / Colorado region , he had relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 2013 . Churchill also stated that he had a half @-@ dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish and publish in the next three years .

= = Early life and education = =

Churchill was born in Urbana , Illinois , to Jack LeRoy Churchill and <unk> Lucretia Allen . His parents divorced before he was two , and he grew up in Elmwood , where he attended local schools .
In 1966 , he was drafted into the United States Army . On his 1980 resume , he said he served as a public @-@ information specialist who " wrote and edited the battalion newsletter and wrote news releases . "
In a 1987 profile on Churchill , the Denver Post reported that he was drafted , went to paratrooper school , then volunteered for Vietnam , where he served a 10 @-@ month tour as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol ( <unk> ) , one of a six @-@ man team sent out to track down the enemy . The Post article also reported that Churchill was politically radicalized as a result of his experiences in Vietnam . Churchill told the Post that he had spent some time at the Chicago office of the Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) in the late 1960s , and briefly taught members of the Weather Underground how to build bombs and fire weapons .
In 2005 , the Denver Post reported that Churchill 's military records show he was trained as a film projectionist and light truck driver , but they do not reflect paratrooper school or <unk> training . The 75th Ranger Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit , or a <unk> team .
Churchill received his B.A. in technological communications in 1974 and M.A. in communications theory in 1975 , both from Sangamon State University , now the University of Illinois at Springfield .

= = Career = =

In 1978 , Churchill began working at the University of Colorado Boulder as an affirmative action officer in the university administration . He also lectured on American Indian issues in the ethnic studies program . In 1990 , the University of Colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position . The following year he was granted tenure in the Communications department , without the usual six @-@ year probationary period , after having been declined by the Sociology and Political Science departments .
He has long been interested in issues associated with the Dawes Act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . Connected with that was the federal government 's first use of " blood quantum " to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the Dawes Rolls . Since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments , federally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum . Some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government 's policy of genocide against Native Americans .
In 1995 Churchill discussed his views with David Barsamian in an interview :
You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in Ibero @-@ America . But in Anglo @-@ America , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the General <unk> Act , mid @-@ 1880s . At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was demonstrably and <unk> of at least one @-@ quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group . You couldn 't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian . You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . The reason for this was quite clear . They were identifying Indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point . If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus . So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available . It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to Indianness in the first place . It 's become increasingly so ever since . " ( David Barsamian ( December 1995 ) . " Interview with Ward Churchill : Historical and Current Perspectives " . Z Magazine . )
In 1996 , Churchill moved to the new Ethnic Studies Department of the University of Colorado . In 1997 , he was promoted to full professor . He was selected as chairman of the department in June 2002 .
In January 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 remarks , Churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado â€” his term as chair was scheduled to expire in June of that year . On May 16 , 2006 , the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct at the University of Colorado concluded that Churchill had committed multiple counts of academic misconduct , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and falsification . On July 24 , 2007 , Churchill was fired for academic misconduct in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado 's Board of Regents .

= = Genealogy and Tribal affiliation = =

In 2003 , Churchill stated , " I am myself of Muscogee and Creek descent on my father 's side , Cherokee on my mother 's , and am an enrolled member of the United <unk> Band of Cherokee Indians . " In 1992 , Churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @-@ eighth Creek and one @-@ sixteenth Cherokee . In 1993 , Churchill told the Colorado Daily that " he was one @-@ sixteenth Creek and Cherokee . " Churchill told the Denver Post in February 2005 that he is three @-@ sixteenths Cherokee .
In a statement dated May 9 , 2005 , and posted on its website , the United <unk> Band initially said ,
" The United <unk> Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill IS NOT a member of the <unk> Band and was only given an honorary ' associate membership ' in the early 1990s because he could not prove any Cherokee ancestry . " The tribe said that all of Churchill 's " past , present and future claims or assertions of <unk> ' enrollment , ' written or spoken , including but not limited to ; biographies , curriculum vitae , lectures , applications for employment , or any other reference not listed herein , are deemed fraudulent by the United <unk> Band . "
Two days later , the United <unk> Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill 's " alleged ancestry " of being Cherokee :
" Because Mr. Churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the <unk> in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an ' Associate Membership ' as an honor , " the tribe 's website now said . " However , Mr. Churchill may possess eligibility status for Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 Cherokee . "
The tribe 's spokesperson , Lisa <unk> , stated the tribe enrolls only members with certified one @-@ quarter American Indian blood . The website statement further clarified that Churchill " was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a ' Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood ( <unk> ) " , and the associate membership did not entitle an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe .
Churchill has never asked for <unk> certification , and finds the idea of being " vetted " by the US government offensive .
In June 1994 , the United <unk> Band had voted to stop awarding associate memberships . Such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with Indian ancestry , and it does not entitle an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . The <unk> Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . In a separate interview , Ernestine Berry , formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years on its council , said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe .
In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill 's genealogy and family history . It " turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor " among 142 direct ancestors [ of Churchill 's ] identified from records . The News reported that both Churchill 's birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census , as were all but two of his great @-@ great @-@ grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents . The News found that some of Churchill 's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records . Numerous members of Churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends of Indian ancestry among ancestors ; but , none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of Churchill who were identified .
Documents in Churchill 's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a " special opportunity position . " In 1994 , then CU @-@ Boulder Chancellor James Corbridge refused to take action on allegations that Churchill was fraudulently claiming to be an Indian , saying " it has always been university policy that a person 's race or ethnicity is self @-@ proving . "
Some of Churchill 's Native American critics , such as Vernon Bellecourt ( White Earth Ojibwe ) and Suzan Shown <unk> ( Southern Cheyenne @-@ Muscogee Creek ) , argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination . The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . The University of Colorado 's Research Misconduct Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to " add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . " The committee concluded that the allegation was not " appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct . "
In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News , Churchill said , " I have never been confirmed as having one @-@ quarter blood , and never said I was . And even if [ the critics ] are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue ? I have never claimed to be goddamned Sitting Bull . " The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year , " So I want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full @-@ blooded Indian leader . "

= = = Blood quantum = = =

Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his claimed Indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements . Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of <unk> in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency .
For decades in his writings , Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose . He says ,
" Set the blood quantum at one @-@ quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians , let intermarriage proceed as it [ has ] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence " .
Churchill 's assertions have been raised as one of the several research @-@ misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 ( see below ) . He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member .

= = Writing = =

Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture , and speaks about genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day .
As of 2007 , according to a report submitted on his behalf , Churchill has written 10 books on his own and co @-@ authored 4 . Some have been reprinted with updates . He has written 51 book chapters , 3 law reviews , and 50 scholarly essays ; 27 of these were refereed . He has edited 4 volumes and co @-@ edited 3 more .
According to the University of Colorado investigation , " His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation , drawing upon studies by other scholars , not monographs describing new research based on primary sources . " The investigation also noted that " he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainstream peer @-@ reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics . " In addition to his academic writing , Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion .
In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled Pacifism as Pathology : Notes on an American <unk> criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical , de facto racist and ineffectual . In 1998 , Arbeiter Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled Pacifism as Pathology : Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author . The book included a preface by Ed Mead , a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan . The book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti @-@ globalization movement in the following few years .
Agents of Repression ( 1988 ) , co @-@ authored by Jim Vander Wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the Black Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and ' 70s by the FBI under the COINTELPRO program . The COINTELPRO Papers ( 1990 ; reissued 2002 ) , also co @-@ authored with Jim Vander Wall , examines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau 's activities against various leftist groups , from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s .
In Fantasies of the Master Race ( 1992 ) , Churchill examines the portrayal of American Indians and the use of American Indian symbols in popular American culture . He focuses on such phenomena as Tony <unk> 's mystery novels , the film Dances with Wolves , and the New Age movement , finding examples of cultural imperialism and exploitation . Churchill calls author Carlos Castaneda 's claims of revealing the teachings of a Yaqui Indian shaman , the " greatest hoax since Piltdown Man . "
Struggle for the Land ( 1993 ; reissued 2002 ) is a collection of essays in which Churchill chronicles what he describes as the U.S. government 's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians . He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent defoliation and industrial practices such as surface mining .
Churchill 's Indians Are Us ? ( 1994 ) , a sequel to Fantasies of the Master Race , further explores American Indian issues in popular culture and politics . He examines the movie Black Robe , the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation killings , the prosecution of Leonard <unk> , sports mascots , the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of genocide . Churchill is particularly outspoken about New Age exploitations of shamanism and American Indian sacred traditions , and the " do @-@ it @-@ yourself <unk> " of certain contemporary authors . John P. <unk> of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us ? in The American Indian Quarterly . Professor <unk> , an enrolled member of the Santee Sioux Nation , states that Indians Are Us ? twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes . It was in this book that Churchill first made the claim that the United States distributed " smallpox @-@ infested blankets " to Indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade . The claim has been criticized as a falsification . Churchill has , however , received support from some scholars .
From a Native Son : Selected Essays on <unk> , 1985 â€“ 1995 ( 1996 ) is a collection of 23 previously published essays on Native American history , culture , and political activism . In his introduction to this volume , Howard Zinn lauds " the emergence of a new generation of Native @-@ American scholars " and describes Churchill 's writing as " powerful , eloquent , unsparing of cant and deception " .
Churchill 's A Little Matter of Genocide ( 1997 ) is a survey of ethnic cleansing in the Americas from 1492 to the present . He compares the treatment of North American Indians to historical instances of genocide by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , Turks against Armenians , and Europeans against the Gypsies , as well as Nazis against the Poles and Jews .
In <unk> of Justice ( 2002 ) , Churchill argues that the U.S. ' s legal system was adapted to gain control over Native American people . Tracing the evolution of federal Indian law , Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non @-@ Indians in the U.S. , but later adapted for application abroad . He concludes that this demonstrates the development of the U.S. ' s " imperial logic , " which depends on a " corrupt form of legalism " to establish colonial control and empire .
Churchill 's controversial essay on 9 / 11 was expanded into a book @-@ length manuscript , published as On the Justice of Roosting Chickens : Reflections on the Consequences of U.S. Imperial Arrogance and <unk> ( 2003 ) by AK Press . The book features two other chapters , one listing US military interventions , another listing what Churchill believes to be US violations of international law . The original essay takes the " roosting chickens " of the title from a 1963 Malcolm X speech , in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy to the violence which Kennedy perpetuated as " merely a case of chickens coming home to roost . " Churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by U.S. imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries .
In Kill the Indian , Save the Man : The Genocidal Impact of American Indian Residential Schools ( 2004 ) , Churchill traces the history of removing American Indian children from their homes to residential schools ( in Canada ) or Indian boarding schools ( in the USA ) as part of government policies ( 1880s â€“ 1980s ) which he regards as genocidal .

= = Activism on Native American issues = =

Churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co @-@ director of the Denver @-@ based American Indian Movement of Colorado , now an autonomous chapter of the American Indian Movement . In 1993 , he and other local AIM leaders , including Russell Means , Glenn T. Morris , Robert <unk> , and David Hill , broke with the national AIM leadership , including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde Bellecourt , claiming that all AIM chapters are autonomous . The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group . It says that the schism arose when Means , Churchill , Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group <unk> , who were allied with the anti @-@ revolutionary , CIA @-@ backed Contras .
Journalists such as Harlan <unk> attributed the split to Means and other AIM members dividing over opposition to the Bellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of Anna Mae <unk> in December 1975 , who was then the highest @-@ ranking woman in AIM but had been suspected of being an informant . It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM . On November 3 , 1999 , Means held a press conference in Denver , Colorado in which he accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in <unk> 's death , and named three lower @-@ level AIM members involved in her death : Arlo Looking Cloud , John Graham , and Theda Nelson Clark . This was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of the <unk> murder had publicly accused AIM of having been involved .
Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 , by federal and South Dakota state juries , respectively . By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted . Means attributed the split in AIM to divisions in the aftermath of <unk> 's murder . The journalist Harlan <unk> said in 1999 , " ... her [ <unk> 's ] death has divided the American Indian Movement ... "
The schism continued , with the national AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders , such as Churchill , are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians . The leaders of the national AIM organization , now called AIM Grand Governing Council , claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter @-@ intelligence source for the U.S. government , for example the FBI , and local , non @-@ Indian , police forces , to subvert the national AIM organization . Specifically , they refer to a 1993 Boulder , Colorado interview with Jodi Rave , a former columnist for the Denver Post , in which Churchill stated that he " was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement . " In addition , Vernon Bellecourt accused Churchill of having ' fraudulently represented himself as an Indian ' to bolster his credentials . Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986 .
Churchill has been a leader of Colorado AIM 's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its associated parade . Colorado AIM 's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community , the main supporters of the parade . As early as 2004 , Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , overriding the First Amendment rights of non @-@ Native Americans .

= = 9 / 11 essay controversy = =

Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of Roosting Chickens . In it , he argued that the September 11 attacks were provoked by U.S. foreign policy . He compared the role of financial workers at the World Trade Center in " ongoing genocidal American imperialism " to the role played by Adolf Eichmann in organizing the Holocaust . In 2005 , this essay was widely publicized when Hamilton College invited Churchill to speak . This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter @-@ accusations of McCarthyism by Churchill and supporters . Following the controversy , the University of Colorado interim Chancellor Phil <unk> said , " While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on 9 / 11 has outraged and appalled us and the general public . "
A documentary called Shouting Fire : Stories from the Edge of Free Speech , broadcast on HBO , prominently features Churchill 's case in addressing the issues of free speech and First Amendment rights .

= = Research misconduct investigation = =

The controversy attracted increased academic attention to Churchill 's research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar John <unk> and historian Guenter Lewy . Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown , who had been preparing an article on Churchill 's work , and the historians R.G. Robertson and Russell Thornton , who claimed that Churchill had misrepresented their work . In 2005 , University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct , including three allegations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the Dawes Act , the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 , and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in 1614 and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837 ( not to be confused with the well @-@ documented use of smallpox @-@ infected blankets at Fort Pitt in 1764 ) .
On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the Investigative Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in " serious research misconduct " , including falsification , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions . The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . Churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University 's Privilege and Tenure Committee , which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute <unk> offences . Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal .
On July 24 , 2007 , the University regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct , overruling the recommendation of Privilege and Tenure panel that two be dismissed . By a vote of eight to one , the regents determined to fire Churchill .
The next day , Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views . The jury in Churchill 's suit for reinstatement weighed the university 's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case . As Stanley Fish said , " It was the jury â€™ s task to determine whether Churchill â€™ s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements . " The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill 's firing and rejected the university 's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal . On April 1 , 2009 , a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded $ 1 in damages . As one of the jurors said later in a press interview , " it wasn 't a slap in his face or anything like that when we didn 't give him any money . It 's just that [ Churchill 's attorney ] David Lane kept saying this wasn 't about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that . " Churchill 's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict .
On July 7 , 2009 , Judge Naves found that the defendants ( university ) were entitled to quasi @-@ judicial immunity as a matter of law , vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation . Naves denied Churchill 's request for reinstatement at CU .
Churchill appealed both decisions . On November 24 , 2010 , a three @-@ judge panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court 's decision . In February 2011 , Churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court . In late May 2011 , the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear his case . Court records indicate that oral arguments began June 7 , 2012 . On September 10 , 2012 , the court ruled that the University had " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " , upholding the trial court 's ruling . On April 1 , 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Churchill .

Churchill 's subjects are often American Indian figures and other themes associated with Native American Culture . He uses historical photographs as source material for works . In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market , Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act . It requires that , to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American , artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan . Under federal law , Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American .
Some of Churchill 's pieces may infringe copyrights . For example , his 1981 <unk> Winter Attack was , according to Churchill and others , based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. <unk> Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them . Other copies are available online for purchase . Churchill says that , when he produced Winter Attack , he publicly acknowledged that it was based on <unk> ' work . The online journal <unk> mentions Churchill 's artwork and the controversy surrounding its originality .
