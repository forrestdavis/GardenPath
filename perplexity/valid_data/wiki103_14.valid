Mycena <unk> , commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak @-@ stump bonnet cap , is a species of mushroom in the family Mycenaceae . The <unk> edible mushroom has a reddish @-@ brown bell @-@ shaped cap up to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . The thin stem is up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) tall , whitish to yellow @-@ brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish @-@ brown towards the base in maturity , where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem . The gills are pale brown to pinkish , and the spore print is white . It is a widespread saprobic fungus , and has been found in Europe , North Africa , Asia , Australasia , and North America , where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps , especially of oak . British mycologist E.J.H. Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo . <unk> species with which M. <unk> may be confused include M. galericulata and M. maculata .

= = Taxonomy , phylogeny , and naming = =

First described as Agaricus <unk> by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838 , it was assigned its current name in 1872 by Lucien Quélet . Mycena galericulata var. calopus ( named by Karsten in 1879 ) , and its basionym Agaricus <unk> var. calopus ( named by Fries in 1873 ) , are synonyms .
In a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid <unk> confusa , M. <unk> was found to be closely related to M. aurantiomarginata , M. <unk> , and M. <unk> .
The specific epithet <unk> means " bent in " . The mushroom is commonly known as the " clustered bonnet " or the " oak @-@ stump bonnet cap " .

= = Description = =

The cap is light reddish @-@ brown , with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 8 in ) . Initially conic to bell @-@ shaped to convex , it flattens during maturity , developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap . The margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops . The surface is moist and smooth , and hygrophanous . The cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap ) . The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly mealy odor and taste . The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem ( that is , running down the length of the stem ) and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red . They are broad ( between 3 and 6 mm ) , and have a close to subdistant spacing , with about 26 – 35 gills reaching the stem . The fragile stem is 3 to 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 5 in ) long by 0 @.@ 15 to 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 06 to 0 @.@ 16 in ) thick and yellow to yellow @-@ brown , becoming reddish @-@ brown to orange @-@ brown in the bottom half in maturity . The lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks . Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom , the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem . The edibility of the mushroom is " doubtful " and consumption " best avoided " .

The spores are 7 – 9 by 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm , broadly ellipsoid , smooth , and strongly amyloid ( it turns black when treated with Melzer 's reagent ) . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) are not differentiated . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous , club @-@ shaped , 26 – 36 by 5 – 10 μm , and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick . The flesh of the gills is homogeneous , and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine . The flesh of the cap has a distinct pellicle , a well @-@ differentiated hypoderm ( a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle ) , and a filamentous tramal body ( gill tissue ) ; it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain .

E.J.H. Corner defined the varieties M. <unk> var. kinabaluensis and var. <unk> in his 1994 publication on Agaric mushrooms of <unk> , a biogeographical region straddling the boundary of the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones . The variety kinabaluensis ( named after its type locality , Kinabalu ) has a cap margin that is not scalloped , little or no odor , and cheilocystidia with shorter processes . It was found growing on the dead wood of Lithocarpus <unk> , a stone oak tree in the beech family . Variety <unk> , found in Sabah , has spores that are almost spherical .

Mycena maculata bears some resemblance to M. <unk> , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found in eastern North America , and sometimes on oak on the West Coast . In age , it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. <unk> . M. <unk> is often confused with the edible M. galericulata , a common species that is variable in cap color , size and shape . M. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray @-@ brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross @-@ veins . M. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish @-@ gray .

= = Habitat and distribution = =

Mycena <unk> is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin .
The fruit bodies of Mycena <unk> grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut ) during the spring and autumn . The fungus forms a white , woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves . Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York . It has been found in Oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast . The range of the fungus also includes Europe , the Canary Islands , North Africa , East Siberia , Japan , <unk> , Turkey , and New Zealand .

In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in <unk> ( Turkey ) , M. <unk> was found to have comparatively high levels of iron ( 628 mg per kg ) and nickel ( 21 @.@ 6 mg / kg ) , measured on a dry weight basis . Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum . The fungus has been investigated for its ability to <unk> synthetic dyes that are used in the textile , plastics , biomedical and foodstuff industries . The dyes are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic .
