The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple @-@ pyramids . On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis .
The Central Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza .
The North Acropolis , together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the Tikal Project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . It is a complex group with construction beginning in the Preclassic Period , around 350 BC . It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gradually hiding it from view . Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an elaborate <unk> and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods . By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the Postclassic Period .
The South Acropolis is found next to Temple V. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) .
The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis . It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side .
The Mundo Perdido is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the Preclassic period at Tikal . The complex was organized as a large E @-@ Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples . The Mundo Perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history . By AD 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico , including the use of the talud @-@ tablero form . During the Early Classic period ( c . 250 – 600 ) the Mundo Perdido became one of the twin foci of the city , the other being the North Acropolis . From AD 250 to 378 it may have served as the royal necropolis . The Mundo Perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it .
Group G lies just south of the Mendez Causeway . The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace @-@ type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at Tikal . It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of 29 vaulted chambers . The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey . One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask .
Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza . It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic .
There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid Complexes at Tikal , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed . They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis . These pyramids are flat @-@ topped and have stairways on all four sides . A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly equidistant from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways . The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 @-@ year ( or k 'atun ) intervals during the Late Classic . The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza . It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as Yaxha and <unk> , and they may reflect the extent of Tikal 's political dominance in the Late Classic .
Group Q is a twin @-@ pyramid complex , and is one of the largest at Tikal . It was built by Yax Nuun Ayiin II in 771 in order to mark the end of the 17th K 'atun . Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re @-@ erected .
Group R is another twin @-@ pyramid complex , dated to 790 . It is close to the Maler Causeway .

There are thousands of ancient structures at Tikal and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work . The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple structure on their summits . Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high . They were numbered sequentially during the early survey of the site . It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years .
Temple I ( also known as the Temple of Ah Cacao or Temple of the Great Jaguar ) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to Jasaw Chan K <unk> , who was entombed in the structure in AD 734 , the pyramid was completed around 740 – 750 . The temple rises 47 metres ( 154 ft ) high . The massive <unk> that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives . The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey <unk> of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962 . Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people , finely carved and rubbed with vermilion , as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink . The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams . The outermost lintel is plain but the two inner lintels were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in Europe .
Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask ) it was built around AD 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high . Like other major temples at Tikal , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels , only the middle of which was carved . The temple was dedicated to the wife of Jasaw Chan K <unk> , although no tomb was found . The queen 's portrait was carved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine . One of the beams from this lintel is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the Jaguar Priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at Tikal . It stood 55 metres ( 180 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel , possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD 810 . The temple shrine possesses two chambers .
Temple IV is the tallest temple @-@ pyramid at Tikal , measuring 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb . Temple IV marks the reign of <unk> ’ in Chan <unk> ( Ruler B , the son of Ruler A or Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I ) and two carved wooden lintels over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 @.@ 15 @.@ 10 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 ) that corresponds to CE 741 ( Sharer 1994 : 169 ) . Temple IV is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the 8th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre @-@ Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at El Mirador .
Temple V stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler . The temple stands 57 metres ( 187 ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure at Tikal - only Temple IV is taller . The temple has been dated to about AD 700 , in the Late Classic period , via radiocarbon analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of Nun Bak Chak in the second half of the 7th century .
Temple VI is also known as the Temple of the Inscriptions and was dedicated in AD 766 . It is notable for its 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft ) high roof @-@ comb . Panels of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof @-@ comb . The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is unrestored .
Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of Siyaj Chan K 'awiil I ( known as Burial 48 ) in the North Acropolis . It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( Burial 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( Burial 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building . The pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall . The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction .
Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II over the tomb of his father , Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine , the rooms situated one behind the other .
Structure 5D @-@ 43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza , built over a pre @-@ existing twin pyramid complex . It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side . The building has a talud @-@ tablero platform profile , modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan . In fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with El <unk> and <unk> than with Teotihuacan itself . The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols . Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels , related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan . The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth . The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake . The temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I , in the later part of the 7th century .
Structure 5C @-@ 49 possesses a clear Teotihuacan @-@ linked architectural style ; it has balustrades , an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region , and a talud @-@ tablero façade ; it dates to the 4th century AD . It is located near to the Lost World pyramid .
Structure 5C @-@ 53 is a small Teotihuacan @-@ style platform that dates to about AD 600 . It had stairways on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure .
The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure 5C @-@ 54 ) is the largest structure in the Mundo Perdido complex . It lies in the southwest portion of Tikal ’ s central core , south of Temple III and west of Temple V. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late Preclassic ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un @-@ impacted by later building activity at Tikal . By the end of the Late Preclassic this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region . It attained its final form during the reign of Chak Tok Ich 'aak in the 4th century AD , in the Early Classic , standing more than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) high with stairways on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from perishable materials . Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex adheres to the layout that defines the so @-@ called E @-@ Groups , identified as solar observatories .
Structure 5D @-@ 96 is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull @-@ and @-@ crossbones motifs .
Group 6C @-@ 16 is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated . It lies a few hundred metres south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks , ballplayer murals , relief sculptures and buildings with Teotihuacan characteristics .
The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis .
The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III . It has two storeys , with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey , which has been restored . The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows .
Complex N lies to the west of the Bat Palace and Temple III . The complex dates to AD 711 .

= = = Altars = = =

Altar 5 is carved with two nobles , one of whom is probably Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman . Altar 5 was found in Complex N , which lies to the west of Temple III .
Altar 8 is sculpted with a bound captive . It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City .
Altar 9 is associated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive . It is located in front of Temple VI .
Altar 10 is carved with a captive tied to a scaffold . It is in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion .
Altar 35 is a plain monument associated with Stela 43 . The stela @-@ altar pair is centrally located at the base of the stairway of Temple IV .

= = = <unk> = = =

At Tikal , beams of <unk> wood were placed as lintels spanning the inner doorways of temples . These are the most elaborately carved wooden lintels to have survived anywhere in the Maya region .
<unk> 3 from Temple IV was taken to Basel in Switzerland in the 19th century . It was in almost perfect condition and depicts <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil seated on a palanquin .

= = = Stelae = = =

Stelae are carved stone shafts , often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs . A selection of the most notable stelae at Tikal follows :
Stela 1 dates to the 5th century and depicts the king Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II in a standing position .
Stela 4 is dated to AD 396 , during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the intrusion of Teotihuacan in the Maya area . The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities , and deities from both cultures . It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other . His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent . Unusually for Maya sculpture , but typically for Teotihuacan , Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face , rather than in profile .
Stela 5 was dedicated in 744 by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil .
Stela 6 is a badly damaged monument dating to 514 and bears the name of the " Lady of Tikal " who celebrated the end of the 4th K 'atun in that year .
Stela 10 is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged . It described the accession of <unk> ' B 'alam in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career , including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument .
Stela 11 was the last monument ever erected at Tikal ; it was dedicated in 869 by Jasaw Chan K 'awiil II .
Stela 12 is linked to the queen known as the " Lady of Tikal " and king <unk> ' B 'alam . The queen is described as performing the year @-@ ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king .
Stela 16 was dedicated in 711 , during the reign of Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I. The sculpture , including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text , are limited to the front face of the monument . It was found in Complex N , west of Temple III .
Stela 18 was one of two stelae erected by Yax Nuun Ayiin I to celebrate the k 'atun @-@ ending of AD 396 . It was re @-@ erected at the base of Temple 34 , his funerary shrine .
Stela 19 was dedicated in 790 by Yax Nuun Ayiin II .
Stela 20 was found in Complex P , in Group H , and was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City .
Stela 21 was dedicated in 736 by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil . Only the bottom of the stela is intact , the rest having been mutilated in ancient times . The surviving sculpture is of fine quality , consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text . The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI .
Stela 22 was dedicated in 771 by Yax Nuun Ayiin II in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex . The face of the figure on the stela has been mutilated .
Stela 23 was broken in antiquity and was re @-@ erected in a residential complex . The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so @-@ called " Lady of Tikal " , a daughter of Chak Tok Ich 'aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right , being paired with male co @-@ rulers . It dates to the early 6th century .
Stela 24 was erected at the foot of Temple 3 in 810 , accompanied by Altar 7 . Both were broken into fragments in ancient times , although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments .
Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34 , underneath a broken masonry altar . The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken , probably at the beginning of the Late Classic . Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine .
Stela 29 bears a Long Count ( 8 @.@ 12 @.@ 14 @.@ 8 @.@ 15 ) date equivalent to AD 292 , the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands . The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph . It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god , one of the patron deities of the city . The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later , the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III , to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959 .
Stela 30 is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus . Its style and iconography is similar to that of Caracol , one of the more important of Tikal 's enemies .
Stela 31 is the accession monument of Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II , also bearing two portraits of his father , Yax Nuun Ayiin , as a youth dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior . He carries a <unk> in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of Tlaloc , the Teotihuacan war god . In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried . Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal . A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument , the longest to survive from the Early Classic , which describes the arrival of <unk> K 'ak ' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378 . It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces .
Stela 32 is a fragmented monument with a foreign Teotihuacan @-@ style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god Tlaloc , including his goggle eyes and tasselled headdress .
Stela 39 is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex . The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich 'aak , holding a flint axe in his left hand . He is trampling the figure of a bound , richly dressed captive . The monument is dated to AD 376 . The text on the back of the monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a <unk> @-@ ending . The stela also names Chak Tok Ich 'aak I 's father as K 'inich Muwaan Jol .
Stela 40 bears a portrait of Kan Chitam and dates to AD 468 .
Stela 43 is paired with Altar 35 . It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple IV .

= = = Burials = = =

Burial 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex . A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb , with the handle formed from three @-@ dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two @-@ dimensional body painted on the lid .
Burial 10 is the tomb of Yax Nuun Ayiin . It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis . The tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . A dog was also entombed with the deceased king . Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles . Among the offerings was an incense @-@ burner in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands . The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault , then the pyramid was built on top .
Burial 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of Siyaj Chan K <unk> . It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis . The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler . The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king . The king 's skeleton was missing its skull , its femurs and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact .
Burial 85 dates to the Late Preclassic and was enclosed by a platform , with a primitive corbel vault . The tomb contained a single male skeleton , which lacked a skull and its thighbones . The dynastic founder of Tikal , Yax Ehb ' Xook , has been linked to this tomb , which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis . The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers . The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle . The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell @-@ inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three @-@ pointed royal headband . This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king . Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine , a <unk> shell and twenty @-@ six ceramic vessels .
Burial 116 is the tomb of Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid , below the level of the Great Plaza . The tomb contained rich offerings of <unk> , ceramics , shell and works of art . The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king . One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself .
Burial 195 was flooded with mud in antiquity . This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely rotted away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving hollows in the dried mud . Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K 'awiil , the wooden originals long gone .
Burial 196 is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a jade mosaic vessel topped with the head of the Maize God .
