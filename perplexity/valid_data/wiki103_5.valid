Papa Stour is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland , with a population of under twenty people , some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s . Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828 hectares ( 3 @.@ 2 square miles ) , Papa Stour is the eighth largest island in Shetland . Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs . The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation .
The island has several Neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of Duke Hakon 's 13th @-@ century house dating from the Norse occupation of the island . The population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at <unk> in West Voe . Subsequently there was a steady decline in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s .
Today the main settlement on the island is <unk> , just to the east of which is <unk> Voe from where the <unk> ferry arrives from its base at West <unk> on the Shetland Mainland . Crofting , especially sheep rearing , is the mainstay of island life .
Numerous shipwrecks have occurred around the coast , and the celebrated poem Da Sang o da Papa Men by <unk> recalls the drama of the days when Papa Stour was a centre for deep @-@ sea fishing .

= = Geography = =

Papa Stour is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay . There are 34 kilometres ( 21 mi ) of rugged coastline which is indented by numerous small <unk> and four larger ' voes ' . <unk> Voe ( Old Norse : ' harbour bay ' ) in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch . <unk> Voe to the east ( Old Norse : ' house bay ' ) is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry 's embarkation point .
<unk> Holm and Maiden Stack guard the harbour entrance to the south . The former is a tidal island and was a leper colony until the 18th century ( although it has been suggested that many of the " lepers " there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy ) . The latter 's name relates to a story from the 14th century . Lord Thorvald <unk> is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to " preserve " his daughter from men . Unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped . West Voe , the inner part of which is called ' <unk> <unk> ' is the main <unk> in the north coast , the smaller <unk> Voe lying immediately to the west .
The main settlement on the island today is <unk> , which overlooks <unk> Voe and is surrounded by in @-@ bye land to the east of the hill dyke ( which runs south from West Voe ) . To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf scalping ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior .
The highest point on the island is in the north west at <unk> Field , which rises to 87 metres ( 285 feet ) . <unk> is possibly from the Old Norse for ' heap of stones ' .

In addition to the larger islets mentioned above there are various other isles and skerries around the coast of Papa Stour . They include : <unk> Stack , <unk> Skerry , <unk> Skerry , <unk> Skerry , <unk> Holm , <unk> Stacks , Holm of Melby , Koda Skerry , Lyra Skerry , Skerries of <unk> , Skerry of <unk> , Sula Stack , Swat Skerry , The Horn , <unk> Skerry and Wilma Skerry . The Ve Skerries lie 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to the north west . They include : <unk> , North Skerry , <unk> , <unk> and The Clubb . In between Papa Stour and Ve Skerries lies the shallow bank of Papa @-@ <unk> .
On 21 June 2008 , Stuart Hill , the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare ( 2 @.@ 5 acres ) island of <unk> Holm ( which he has renamed " <unk> Island " ) made a declaration of dependence , creating the Crown Dependency of <unk> . On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to 1468 , Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union . This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom .

= = Geology = =

The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period . At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone , laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier Silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of Pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava ( rhyolite ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation .
Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , cliffs , voes and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain . The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island . It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . Yet another is ' Francie 's Hole ' close to <unk> Voe in the west . This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as :
... in fairyland , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so pellucid is the water ... [ with ] alcoves or recesses like stalls in a church .
In 1953 the spectacular headland , ' Da Horn o Papa ' fell into the sea during a storm . The nearby islet of <unk> Holm also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit .

= = Ecology = =

Otters , grey seals , killer whales and harbour porpoises are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour . Atlantic puffin , Arctic and common tern , <unk> and Arctic skua , northern fulmar , common guillemot , razorbill , curlew , wheatear , ringed plover and great black @-@ backed gull all breed on the island , and numerous migratory species have been recorded .
There is a profusion of wild flowers , including mountain everlasting , spring squill and <unk> as well as the ubiquitous heather . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation . The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred .

= = History and archaeology = =

Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped cairns ' . Little is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning " Big island of the Papar " ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west .

= = = Norse period = = =

Papa Stour is the subject of a 1299 manuscript written in Old Norse , which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland . It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson , who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway . There is a circle of stones near the beach at <unk> Voe , which are the remains of a ' ting ' , or local assembly . This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord Thorvald <unk> , who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘ dominus de <unk> ’ . ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . ) The remains of Duke Hakon 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> Voe .

= = = Scots rule and fishing = = =

In 1469 Shetland came under nominal Scottish control , although the Norse ' Lairds of Norway ' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century . In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish lairds , Thomas Gifford of Busta , and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ oared boats known as <unk> .
In addition to the leper colony on <unk> Holm there may have been another at <unk> <unk> overlooking <unk> Voe . A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony .
The island church , which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> . It is called the ' <unk> kirk ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as " the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " . There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night . Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it .
In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe .
There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or Clack Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below . Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south Mainland of Shetland .

In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa Stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. Mingulay ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 .
Overview of population trends

= = = Shipwrecks = = =

The coasts around Papa Stour have claimed numerous wrecks . In <unk> , <unk> Skerry alone has sunk Dutch , French , German and Norwegian ships .
The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch . When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries . A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . All 9 crew perished in the wreck . Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. <unk> , which were buried in Scalloway .
The cargo ship SS Highcliffe ran aground in fog on <unk> Holm in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost . In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler Juniper ran aground in Lyra Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the coxswain being awarded the RNLI silver medal for this rescue .
Papa Stour 's most recent shipwreck occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , skipper Alec Flett , foundered on the Ve Skerries . The <unk> Lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions . At the request of Alec Webster , Coastguard Station Officer , Lerwick , a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky <unk> helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled . They managed to winch all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at Sumburgh Airport .

Crofting is the mainstay of island life . Sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and geese . Vegetable are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as ' <unk> scrubs ' . Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale . There is a post office at the pier , but no shop . Mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century . The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues . Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West <unk> on the Shetland Mainland . The crossing takes 45 minutes , and although the <unk> carries cars , there is only one short road on the <unk> visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care .

The Papa Stour sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England . A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott .
The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa Stour and Foula for a while during the late nineteenth century . The writer , folklorist and musician , George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa Stour .
It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson . The insistent chorus chant , ' <unk> Foula Doon ! ' , is particularly striking .
" <unk> <unk> da Horn o Papa ,
<unk> Foula <unk> !
<unk> a hidden piece o water ,
<unk> Foula <unk> !
<unk> da boat da tide @-@ lumps <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> da <unk> is <unk> ;
We <unk> <unk> <unk> fish is <unk> ,
<unk> Foula <unk> ! "
" <unk> Foula <unk> ! " refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa Stour . The ' tide @-@ lumps ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water . This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature .
