= = History = =

The portion of current Route 50 between Seaville and Petersburg received funding to become a spur of the Ocean Highway in 1910 . The modern @-@ day alignment of Route 50 was legislated as part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 in 1917 , a route that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , the portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 between Seaville and Egg Harbor City was designated as Route 50 , the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering . Route 50 retained its current routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering . A freeway was proposed for Route 50 around 1960 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township north to US 30 in Mullica Township . This proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County for travelers from the Delaware Valley . However , this freeway was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along Route 50 . On November 21 , 2008 , construction began on making the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the Atlantic City Expressway . This project was completed on June 18 , 2010 .
