Route 29 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 34 @.@ 76 mi ( 55 @.@ 94 km ) from an interchange with Interstate 295 ( I @-@ 295 ) in Hamilton Township in Mercer County , where it continues as I @-@ 195 , to Route 12 ( Bridge Street / Race Street ) in Frenchtown , Hunterdon County . Between the southern terminus and I @-@ 95 , the route is a mix of freeway and four @-@ lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through Trenton . This section includes a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and Riverview Cemetery . North of I @-@ 95 , Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two @-@ lane highway . North of the South Trenton Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and Hunterdon County . The obsolete Delaware & Raritan Canal usually stands between the river and the highway . Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely shaded due to the tree canopy . Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) in Trenton .
Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown Trenton to Newark , following present @-@ day Route 179 and US 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and US 22 between Somerville and Newark . The route between Lambertville and Frenchtown was originally Route 29A . In 1953 , Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route 29A to avoid the concurrencies with the U.S. Routes . Route 29 between South Warren Street in Trenton and I @-@ 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I @-@ 195 / I @-@ 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed . This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 . A realignment of Route 29 in Lambertville by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of 0 @.@ 26 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 42 km ) Route 165 .

= = History = =

The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from Trenton to the New York border in Montague Township . Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from Trenton to Newark . The original route ran from downtown Trenton along State Street and <unk> Drive . From there , it followed its current alignment to Lambertville , where it followed present @-@ day Route 179 to Ringoes to present @-@ day County Route 514 , which it followed to Woods Tavern . The route turned north on U.S. Route 206 ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to Somerville , where it followed U.S. Route 22 to Newark . The current alignment of Route 29 from Lambertville to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route 29A in 1927 .
The alignment of Route 29 between Ringoes and Somerville was eventually shifted to follow present @-@ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between Ringoes and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and Somerville . In 1938 , Route 29B was planned as an extension of Route 29A from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha . While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route 519 . In 1948 , a spur route , Route S29 , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in Lambertville to the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Bridge . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was redefined to continue north from Lambertville to Frenchtown on Route 29A , and the Route 29 designation between Lambertville and Newark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and U.S. Route 22 between Somerville and Newark . The section of former Route 29 between Route 29A and Route S29 became Route 165 .
Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and Lambertville ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175 .
Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township . A two @-@ lane street , Lamberton Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville @-@ Trenton Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 . A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 .
By the 2000s , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .
