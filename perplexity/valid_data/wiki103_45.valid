" Sailor Mouth " was directed by Andrew Overtoom , and was written by Walt Dohrn , Paul Tibbitt , and Merriwether Williams . Dohrn and Tibbitt also served as storyboard directors , and Carson Kugler , William Reiss and Erik Wiese worked as storyboard artists . Series creator Stephen Hillenburg has described the episode plot as " a classic thing all kids go through . " Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers ' own experiences from childhood . The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 21 , 2001 . The episode marks the introduction of Mr. Krabs ' mother , Mama Krabs , who was voiced by former SpongeBob SquarePants creative producer and current executive producer Paul Tibbitt .
The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . The idea for " Sailor Mouth " was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon 's experience " [ when ] I got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother . " Drymon said , " The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle , with SpongeBob chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life . " The end of the episode , where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick , was also inspired " by the fact that my [ Drymon 's ] mother has a sailor mouth herself . "
The scene where SpongeBob and Patrick playing a game of Eels and Escalators , which is a parody of Snakes and Ladders , was difficult for the crew to animate , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . According to the series ' season 2 DVD commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had SpongeBob saying " Go ' dolphin noise ' yourself " followed by Patrick saying " ' Dolphin noise ' you too ! " during the Eels and Escalators game . It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience .
" Sailor Mouth " was released on the DVD compilation called SpongeBob SquarePants : Sea Stories on March 12 , 2002 . It was also included in the SpongeBob SquarePants : The Complete 2nd Season DVD released on October 19 , 2004 . On September 22 , 2009 , " Sailor Mouth " was released on the SpongeBob SquarePants : The First 100 Episodes , alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five .

According to a report titled Wolves in Sheep 's Clothing , which documents the increase in potentially violent , profane , and sexual content in children 's programming , the Parents Television Council , a watchdog media group , and fans believed the SpongeBob SquarePants episode " Sailor Mouth " was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize use of profanity among children . The episode originally aired during the 2001 â€“ 02 television season , ironically the season in which the PTC named SpongeBob SquarePants among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of profanity among children . In a later report , several members of the PTC listed " Sailor Mouth " as an example of how levels of profane , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children 's television programming . Nickelodeon , in response to the incident , said " It 's sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point . Has the FCC looked at this ? " Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants , " Sailor Mouth " , over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly .
