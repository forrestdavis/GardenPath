Ayola began her career in the theatre , performing in a number of Shakespearean plays including Twelfth Night , A Midsummer Night 's Dream , The Tempest , The Merchant of Venice and Macbeth . She states of this : " Shakespeare keeps coming my way . I love the fact that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I 'll ever be " . Ayola has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola . She explains : " The role of Viola didn 't sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense . " She has also appeared in modern performances , assuming the title role of Dido , Queen of Carthage at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003 , which she described as " a dream of a part " . She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure , as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it .
Ayola 's first film appearance was in the 1993 film Great Moments in Aviation , written by Jeanette Winterson , in which she starred alongside Jonathan Pryce and John Hurt . Variety magazine 's David Rooney said of her performance : " In the film 's most naturalistic turn , Ayola is a constant pleasure to watch . <unk> and appealing , she often succeeds in pulling the fanciful fireworks momentarily back down to Earth . " Ayola recalls having been daunted at the prospect of working alongside so many established names , but has deemed it to have been a " wonderful experience " . Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret Laughter of Women , set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth , thriller The i Inside , filmed in Sully Hospital , Cardiff , and starring Ryan Phillippe , and Sahara , filmed in Morocco whilst Ayola was pregnant with her first child , starring Penélope Cruz . Ayola says of her film career : " I really like doing film [ but ] I 've not done enough big films though to really know the difference between film and television . "
Ayola 's first prolific television role was in the ITV drama Soldier Soldier , in which she starred throughout its third series in 1993 as soldier 's wife Bernie Roberts . Ayola credits her chemistry with co @-@ star <unk> <unk> , who played her on @-@ screen husband Luke Roberts , for winning her her audition . She went on to appear in Gone With the Wind sequel Scarlett , and star in Welsh soap opera Tiger Bay . She has spoken critically of the way the BBC treated the soap , moving it around the schedules and declining to commission a second series . She acted alongside Pauline Quirke in both Maisie Raine and Being April , deeming Quirke to be a " fantastic " actress , and one she would work alongside again " like a shot " . In 1996 , Ayola appeared at the National Theatre in Helen <unk> 's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace . In 2001 , she became a presenter of the BBC Wales arts programme Double Yellow , alongside poet Owen <unk> and performance artist Mark Rees . She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show 's launch , and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series . She has since concluded that " the kind of audience they would like to bring in with shows like Double Yellow aren 't really into watching TV " , but at the time was outspoken against the show 's cancellation , stating :
Ayola 's other notable television appearances include the BBC psychological thriller Green @-@ Eyed Monster ( 2001 ) , soap opera EastEnders ( 2001 ) , Waking the Dead ( 2001 ) , London 's Burning ( 2001 ) , Offenders ( 2002 ) , Murder in Mind ( 2003 ) , The Canterbury Tales ( 2003 ) and Sea of Souls ( 2004 ) . In 2008 , she starred in the Doctor Who episode " Midnight " , playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant 's Tenth Doctor . In 2009 , Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family . She stated : " The script made me laugh out loud when I read it . [ ... ] I also like the fact that there were a lot of politically @-@ correct boxes being ticked , but the writers and producer haven 't been restrained by that . " So , instead of bowing to this altar , they 've said , ' Okay , we have this family that 's half @-@ black , half @-@ white , half @-@ American , half @-@ British . We have a mix of boys and girls , one character who 's mixed @-@ raced and deaf – but we 're not going to be restrained by any of that . We 're not going to tiptoe around Martha 's disability or anything . ' I liked that . It wasn 't some sort of reverential hands @-@ off approach to what we 're presenting . " She has also been cast in the film Dredd .

From 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008 , Ayola starred in BBC medical drama Holby City as nurse Kyla Tyson . She had previously appeared in Holby City 's sister show Casualty , and had made an appearance in Holby City 's fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson . She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin . After a series of three meetings , a year after the birth of her first child , she agreed to assume the role of Kyla , despite being " nervous about signing such a long contract " , stating : " I 've been someone who 's loved the uncertainty of acting . I 've loved that one month it 's Sahara in Morocco and the next I 'm doing a stage play , then it 's a six @-@ part telly thing . But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks . It would be nice just to stay put for a while . If I 'm going to be a working mum I 'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently . And then Holby came along , so I 'm very grateful " .
Ayola signed a three @-@ year contract to play Kyla , and described herself as " very similar " to her character , speaking positively about her working relationship with co @-@ stars Jaye Jacobs and Sharon D. Clarke , as well as the " dream " storylines her character was given . She said of the show :
" I really love Holby and I 'm surprised how much . What thrills me about Holby is that you get back what you put in . The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job . For me it 's about more than turning up and saying the lines . It 's about understanding it and trying to make it better . That 's actually a lot of fun . What 's great is nobody says , ' Just shut up . ' They want you to work at it . [ ... ] I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think , ' do I want to do something else ? ' but I really like this job , I never get that awful ‘ dread ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work . "
In October 2008 , Ayola announced that she would be departing from Holby City in order to have a second child , stating : " I 've had a great time and I 'll miss it . I made the decision purely because I was pregnant , but I wasn 't really ready to put down the character of Kyla . I 'm very sorry to have to let her go . "

Throughout her career , Ayola has been outspoken on the subject of racial discrimination in the entertainment industry . Describing her motivation , she states : " I am not an overtly political person . I just want fairness " . Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts , explaining ; " If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors . [ ... ] They are not being sold as a reason to watch . " She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin , stating : " I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [ ... ] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it 's still very low and expectations are still very low " . She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem , explaining that : " I get offered a lot of very different roles , but they 're never Welsh . [ ... ] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales , but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn 't have been in it " . In 2001 , Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone 's Playground . She presented the film at the Cannes film festival , using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre , films and television . The project , however , was largely unsuccessful , with Ayola stating : " it just made me decide that if there 's anything I don 't want to do , it 's produce films , because I 'm rubbish at it . I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end . " In 2008 , Ayola offered her support to the Action for Southern Africa campaign Dignity ! Period , aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women .
