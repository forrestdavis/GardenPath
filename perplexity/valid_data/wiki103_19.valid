" ... Thirteen Years Later " is the second episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R. Perry , who had previously penned the second season episode " The Mikado " , and would provide a further three scripts in the third season . The episode was directed by Thomas J. Wright , who helmed a total of twenty @-@ six episodes across all three seasons .

The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace Frehley , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . However , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and fax updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace Frehley was also unenthusiastic towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The Nutty Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to fabricate .
Perry has described the production " ... Thirteen Years Later " as being " one of the most gruelling " of the series ' run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this . Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode . Guest star Jeff Yagher , who played killer Mark Bianco , is the husband of actress Megan Gallagher , who starred in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black 's wife Catherine .
