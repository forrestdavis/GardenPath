Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24 , 1910 . It states : " Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome , and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . So the time honored get @-@ togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . The Gales thought well of this established feature . They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests . They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . "
" On the night before such an event neither Mamma , Pappa , or Daughter Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort . At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape . So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie . First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir ; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . Then arrived the guests . The Minister and the Mrs. Minister , they were , and some neighbors . While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring . Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen . She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored . He , too , excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince . No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . She pours ' the right proportion ' in , too . "

The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters .

The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . The reviewer states , " A domestic comedy with a different flavor . In fact , with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . The humor in this piece centers around this pie . What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination . Imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie ! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . The mince pie episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone . " Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated , " To me the last scene had no humor . It was only the necessary ending to the beginning . True humor does not emanate from cognac . " The New York Dramatic Mirror stated , " This is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way . The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing . The character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . "
