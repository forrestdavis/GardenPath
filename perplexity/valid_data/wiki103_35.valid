Hu <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; c . 1584 – 1674 ) was a Chinese artist , printmaker and publisher . He worked in calligraphy , traditional Chinese painting , and seal @-@ carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work .
Hu lived in Nanjing during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty . A Ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the <unk> Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office . He did , however , design the <unk> Emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death in 1645 . He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and embossing techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise . Hu 's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking , leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form .
Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy , an artist 's primer which remained in print for around 200 years . His studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers . Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers .

= = Biography = =

Hu was born in <unk> County , Anhui Province in 1584 or early 1585 . Both his father and elder brother <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) were physicians , and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around Lu 'an and <unk> . It is commonly stated that <unk> himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources attesting to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century .
By 1619 , Hu had moved to Nanjing where he lived with his wife Wu . Their home on <unk> ( <unk> , now also known as <unk> Ge ) , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting @-@ house for like @-@ minded artists . Hu named it the Ten Bamboo Studio ( <unk> , <unk> ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property . It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) and his sons <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , courtesy name <unk> ) .
During Hu 's lifetime , the Ming dynasty , which had ruled China for over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by China 's last imperial dynasty , the Qing . Following the fall of the capital Beijing in 1644 , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in Nanjing with Zhu <unk> on the throne as the <unk> Emperor . Hu , who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor . The court offered him the position of <unk> for the Secretariat ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of <unk> <unk> in some of his subsequent personal seals ) .
According to Wen <unk> 's Lost History of the South ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , prior to the Qing invasion of Nanjing Hu studied at the National University there , and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of Rites to record official proclamations ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( Qin Ban <unk> , <unk> ) and the Record of Displayed Loyalty ( <unk> Ji , <unk> ) as part of this work . As a result , he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained admittance to the Hanlin Academy , but before he could take up this appointment , Beijing had fallen to the Manchu rebellion . Since contemporaneous biographies ( Wen 's work was not published until 1830 ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu 's death .
Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646 , after the end of the Ming dynasty . Xiao <unk> and Lü <unk> recorded visiting him during his later years , in 1667 and 1673 respectively . He died in poverty at the age of 90 , sometime around late 1673 or early 1674 .

= = Seal @-@ carving = =

Hu <unk> was a noted seal @-@ carver , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries . His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty , and he followed the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen . Hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear compositional structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals .
Hu 's work was known outside his local area . Zhou <unk> , a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur , stated in his Biography of Seal @-@ Carvers ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) that Hu " creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure " , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing .
In 1644 , Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the <unk> Emperor , which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer . He presented his creation with an essay , the Great Exhortation of the Seal ( <unk> Zhen , <unk> ) , in which he bemoaned the loss of the Chongzhen Emperor 's seal and begged Heaven 's favour in restoring it . Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally @-@ footed couplets ( <unk> , <unk> ) used in the Imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court .

Despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ carver , Hu was primarily a publisher . His publishing house , the Ten Bamboo Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and phonetics ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics . Unlike other publishers in the area , the Ten Bamboo Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels . This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the Nanjing <unk> ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts . Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten Bamboo Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . The studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , Tested <unk> for Myriad Illnesses ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later . Hu 's brother <unk> was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books .
During the 1630s the Ten Bamboo Studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming Record of Loyalty ( Huang Ming <unk> Ji , <unk> ) , a biography of loyal Ming officials , and the Edicts of the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming <unk> , <unk> ) , a list of Imperial proclamations . After the fall of the Ming Dynasty , Hu renamed the studio the Hall Rooted in the Past ( <unk> , <unk> ) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the Ten Bamboo imprint continued to be used . Despite Hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu 's carving work .
The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China . At his studio , Hu <unk> experimented with various forms of woodblock printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and embossed printed designs . As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as " assorted block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . It was a lengthy , painstaking process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image . Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible .
In some images , Hu employed a blind embossing technique ( known as " embossed designs " ( <unk> , <unk> ) or " embossed blocks " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , using an <unk> , imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants . This was a relatively new process , having been invented by Hu 's contemporary Wu <unk> , who was also a Nanjing @-@ based publisher . Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio Letter Paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , published in 1626 . Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio .

Hu 's most notable work is the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in 1633 . It consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes . As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic primer , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy . Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting . In this book , Hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . The manual is bound in the " butterfly binding " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , whereby whole @-@ folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread . This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image . Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in August , 2015 . Said Charles Aylmer , Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , " The binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was digitized , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars . "
This volume went on to influence colour printing across China , where it paved the way for the later but better @-@ known Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and also in Japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in ukiyo @-@ e of the colour woodblock printing process known as nishiki @-@ e <unk> . The popularity of the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty .
Hu also produced the work Ten Bamboo Studio Letter Paper ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the <unk> stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief . Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . The book was bound in the " wrapped back " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , in which the folio pages are folded , stacked , and sewn along the open edges . Originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by Zheng Zhenduo and Lu Xun , and revised and republished again in 1952 .

Other works produced by Hu 's studio included a reprint of Zhou <unk> 's manual of seal @-@ script calligraphy , The Six Styles of Calligraphy , Correct and Erroneous ( <unk> Zheng 'e , <unk> ) and the related Necessary Investigations into Calligraphy ( <unk> Bi Ji , <unk> ) , which discussed common errors in the formation of characters . With his brother <unk> , Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics , entitled The <unk> Text of the Four Books , Identified and Corrected ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1640 ) , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text . A similar approach was taken with the Essentials of the Thousand Character Classic in Six Scripts ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1663 ) , which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , Li Deng . It was published after Li 's death , partly in homage to him .
The three Hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye <unk> , which was called simply the Discussion of Poetry ( Shi Tan , <unk> ) ( 1635 ) . Other works on poetry from the studio included Helpful Principles to the Subtle <unk> of Selected Tang Poems ( <unk> Tang Shi <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included <unk> by Hu <unk> himself .
Among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text on Chinese dominoes entitled <unk> Fuyu ( <unk> ) , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu <unk> .
