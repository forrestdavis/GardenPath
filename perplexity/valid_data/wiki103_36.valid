She performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the American premieres of several works by Erik Satie , Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky , including the title role in the latter 's <unk> .
The niece of Lady Laurier and Sir Wilfrid Laurier , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in Europe . She then travelled to Java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to North American audiences on her return . She retired from performing in 1937 , and opened a voice studio in New York , where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors . Gauthier was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music . The citation from the Campion Society of San Francisco , which she received in 1949 , said : " ... her rare open @-@ mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers "

Born in Ottawa , Ontario , Gauthier received musical lessons as a child , in harmony , voice , and piano . The custom of the time dictated that North American musicians travel to Europe for training if they desired a reputable professional career , and in July 1902 , at the age of seventeen , Gauthier set out for Europe , financed by her aunt and uncle , Lady Zoé Laurier and Sir Wilfrid Laurier .

Gauthier travelled to France , where she received private voice lessons from Auguste @-@ Jean <unk> of the Paris Conservatory . <unk> on her vocal cords were problematic , but they were removed surgically . She later began training under Jacques <unk> , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique . In 1906 , Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degree of mentorship to Gauthier during the 30 week tour of Canada .
Lord Strathcona awarded Gauthier a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies . She returned there and continued both to study and give performances . Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in Pavia , Italy as Micaëla in Bizet 's Carmen . She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes ' Lakmé , which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company . The opera opened in June 1910 . Supposedly , Luisa <unk> , the prima donna soprano of the company , feared that Gauthier 's voice would outshine her own , and demanded that Gauthier be removed from the opera . The company 's director acquiesced to <unk> 's demands , informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing . Gauthier reacted badly , and quit opera entirely .

Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene , Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java . There , she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans <unk> . Gauthier and <unk> married on May 22 , 1911 . Gauthier studied the music of Java , and began to include this in her repertoire . Her accompanying pianist was Paul <unk> , who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta , which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities . On permission of the Javanese court , she studied the gamelan , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity . While living in Java , Gauthier travelled extensively , giving performances in China , Japan , Singapore , Malaya , Australia , and New Zealand . She remained in Java for four years , but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America , arriving in New York City in the fall of 1915 .

Arriving in New York , Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene . She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled <unk> , which combined Javan music with dancers . New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers , so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing . Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall , and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers . She developed her own reputation quickly , known as a " ... sensitive purveyor of interesting , untried songs " . She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel . Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky 's Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes ' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan . The performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers . Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces .
Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America . Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik Satie and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert . She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg . Through this , Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States . She also included American music in all of her concerts . Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 . She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics .
Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled " Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice " became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent <unk> Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .
Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences . On some occasions , such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925 , as well as in London in 1925 , this was quite successful . A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert , Brahms , Wolf , Richard Strauss - while praising her skill with more classical choices . Other performances suffered – she was booed while performing works by Heitor Villa @-@ Lobos at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice . She became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the United States , Europe , and her native Canada . On the sixtieth anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1927 , she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first transcontinental radio broadcast in Canada . Although she toured Canada from time to time , and attended performances of Canadian music in New York , she held a negative opinion of Canada 's treatment of native musicians , saying " Canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people . "

= = = Retirement from the stage = = =

Illness forced Gauthier to halt giving performances in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in 1931 , giving a concert in Havana , Cuba . As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing . Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring . She retired from performing entirely in 1937 , and opened a music studio in New York . There she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists , serving on its board of governors . She died on December 20 , 1958 .

= = Views of critics and audiences = =

Gauthier was a controversial musician in her time . Her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised . The appropriateness of jazz music for a classically trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to cheer her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to condemn her for taking lowbrow music into a highbrow venue .
A May 1 , 1917 review by the New York Times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the unpolished quality of her voice . Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : " ... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them . "
A November 12 , 1923 Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs , as well as modern English , French , Austrian , German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music . The critic remarked " Her voice was much too good for jazz . " Here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was " ... neat and expressive . " The audience received the concert very enthusiastically .
Her performance in Fargo in 1923 resulted in a headline in the Fargo Forum the next day that was headed Eva Gauthier ’ s Program Sets Whole Town <unk> : Many People Are of Two Minds Regarding Jazz Numbers – Some Reluctantly Admit That They Like Them – Others Keep Silent or <unk> Them . The review divides the audience and critics into various camps : those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance ; those who openly disliked and condemned it ; those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate ; and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or uncultured .
